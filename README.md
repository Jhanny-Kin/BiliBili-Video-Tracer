# BIliBIli-video-tracer

Run [ pip install bs4 requests ] in terminal for module dependency

Auto version: you can use it for either tracing a video in crontab or running at the backend of you computer, and all information will be stored in an addition text file in the folder of the script.

Manual version: the script only pulls the video information once, but it includes some simple interface and some extra info as well. Nothing is going to be stored, so it's just for test before you use the auto version.

Note: The minimum time between two runs of the script is one minute as BiliBili refrash the data every minute.
